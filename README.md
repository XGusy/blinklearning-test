# Blinklearning test

To start this project you only need to install the dependencies run `npm install` on the project folder and then `npm run start` to run the project in localhost.

## About the logic

The code was partially built thinking on a dynamic scenario.

The changes that i could do to make it more dynamic its to use images linked to response options by his unique ids. This way we can load all the test resources dinamically with the data get from API. 

Another important change its to make scalable the redux data, so maybe we can make it more structurated with multiple tests, having inside everyone his test id, answers, responses and other necessary data. All of this inside an javascript object.
