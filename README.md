## About

The code was partially built thinking on a dynamic scenario.

The changes that i could do to make it more dynamic its to use images linked to response options by his unique ids. This way we can load all the test resources dinamically with the data get from API. 

Another important change its to make the redux data scalable. Maybe make it more structurated with multiple tests, having inside of every test item his test id, answers, responses and other necessary data. All of this inside an javascript object.
